TASK 1
Connect VPC to S3 bucket using VPC Gateway Endpoint

1. In the VPC dashboard click on "Endpoints" in the left-hand navigation pane
2. Click on the "Create Endpoint" button
    - Type Endpoint name
    - Select service category as "AWS services"
    - Choose "type = Gateway" as the endpoint type.
    - Select "com.amazonaws.REGION.s3" (replace REGION with the region where your S3 bucket resides) as the service name
    - Choose relevant VPC from the "VPC" dropdown list

    - Click on the "Create endpoint" button to create the VPC endpoint.

3. Check the selected RT, it should be automatically added new route with destination as "S3 buckets" and target "ID of the Endpoints" 
4. To check connectivity between an EC2 instance in your VPC and an S3 bucket/s using a VPC endpoint, 
    - ensure that the instance has necessary IAM permissions to access S3
    - Run AWS CLI commands to access an S3 bucket. For example, to list the contents of an S3 bucket aws s3 ls s3://backet name/
                or get an object from S3 bucket by command aws s3 cp s3://path-to-bucket/ /destination/


TASK 2
Download files from the S3 bucket to the EC2 Instance
1. Upon creating bucket and folder in them, uploading file. Creating regular EC2 instance. 
2. Creating an IAM role
    - In the IAM dashboard click on "Roles" in the left-hand navigation pane
    - Click on the "Create role" button
    - Select "AWS service" as a Trusted entity type
    - Choose EC2 from the "service case" dropdown list
    - At the step 2: search "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess" policy, pick them and click "next"
    - At the step 3: Name the Role, Save it. 
3. Go to created EC2. 
    - Pick them, click on the "Actions" button, go to "Security" section and click on "Modify role"
    - Choose just created IAM role from droplist. Update IAM role. 
4. Go to S3 bucket. 
    - On the top pane got to permissions section
    - Scroll down to Bucket policy and click "edit" button. 
    - Click "Policy generator" button
    - From the Type of Policy droplist choose "S3 Bucket Policy"

    - Click on "Add statement" button 
    - Click on "Generate Policy" button. Copy all generated policy. 
    - Paste the policy, and add "/*" to end bucket's ARN at the Resourse line. (It means that EC2 will have the all objects in the bucket)
    - Save changes. 
5. Connect to EC2.
    - Go to file in the backet, pick them and click on "Copy S3 URI"
    - run the command "aws s3 cp s3://bucket3120/file-sync-service/greyhound_-_dog.jpeg ." the link in this command is copied file URI. "." means destionation to copy the file (current directory)
    - Correct output is "download: s3://bucket3120/file-sync-service/greyhound_-_dog.jpeg to ./greyhound_-_dog.jpeg"
to check downloaded file run the command "ls" 


TASK 3
Create an autoscaling group "SyncService-ASG" with a dynamic scaling policy to have:
min: 1 instance, desired: 1 instance, max: 4 instances
Integrate AutoScaling group with "SyncService" Load balancer.

1. Create Load Balancer (hereandafter as "LB")
    - Go to EC2, go to Load Balancers on the left-hand pane, click on "Create Load Balancer"
    - Choose "Application Load Balancer" type
    - Provide a name to LB
    - Choose "Internet-facing" scheme (An internet-facing load balancer routes requests from clients over the internet to targets. Requires a public subnet)
    - Ip address type leave as "IPv4"

    - pick both AZs and both Public Subnets

    - Type Target group name
    - scroll down to Health checks and type "/index.html (this step is optional)
    - Click "next"
    - DO NOT pick and include as pending any existed EC2. click on "Create target group"
1. Go back to Load Balancer creating window. 
    - Select just created Target group (refresh the droplist)
    - Scroll down and click "Create load balancer" button
