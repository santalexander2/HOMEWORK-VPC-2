TASK 1
Connect VPC to S3 bucket using VPC Gateway Endpoint

1. In the VPC dashboard click on "Endpoints" in the left-hand navigation pane
2. Click on the "Create Endpoint" button
    - Type Endpoint name
    - Select service category as "AWS services"
    - Choose "type = Gateway" as the endpoint type.
    - Select "com.amazonaws.REGION.s3" (replace REGION with the region where your S3 bucket resides) as the service name
    - Choose relevant VPC from the "VPC" dropdown list
    - Choose Route table (it could be already existed public RT)
    - Optionally, configure the endpoint policy to restrict access to specific S3 buckets by clicking "Custom" and use policy generator tool. Or leave it as "Full Access"
    - Tags are optionally. 
    - Click on the "Create endpoint" button to create the VPC endpoint.

3. Check the selected RT, it should be automatically added new route with destination as "S3 buckets" and target "ID of the Endpoints" 
4. To check connectivity between an EC2 instance in your VPC and an S3 bucket/s using a VPC endpoint, 
    - ensure that the instance has necessary IAM permissions to access S3
    - Run AWS CLI commands to access an S3 bucket. For example, to list the contents of an S3 bucket aws s3 ls s3://backet name/
                or get an object from S3 bucket by command aws s3 cp s3://path-to-bucket/ /destination/


TASK 2
Download files from the S3 bucket to the EC2 Instance
1. Upon creating bucket and folder in them, uploading file. Creating regular EC2 instance. 
2. Creating an IAM role
    - In the IAM dashboard click on "Roles" in the left-hand navigation pane
    - Click on the "Create role" button
    - Select "AWS service" as a Trusted entity type
    - Choose EC2 from the "service case" dropdown list
    - At the step 2: search "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess" policy, pick them and click "next"
    - At the step 3: Name the Role, Save it. 
3. Go to created EC2. 
    - Pick them, click on the "Actions" button, go to "Security" section and click on "Modify role"
    - Choose just created IAM role from droplist. Update IAM role. 
4. Go to S3 bucket. 
    - On the top pane got to permissions section
    - Scroll down to Bucket policy and click "edit" button. 
    - Click "Policy generator" button
    - From the Type of Policy droplist choose "S3 Bucket Policy"
    - Effect leave as "Allow"
    - For Principal line go to relevant IAM and grab the ARN of the role. Paste them. 
    - For Actions lane choose from droplist "GetObject" 
    - for ARN lane grep and paste bucket's ARN. 
    - Click on "Add statement" button 
    - Click on "Generate Policy" button. Copy all generated policy. 
    - Paste the policy, and add "/*" to end bucket's ARN at the Resourse line. (It means that EC2 will have the all objects in the bucket)
    - Save changes. 
5. Connect to EC2.
    - Go to file in the backet, pick them and click on "Copy S3 URI"
    - run the command "aws s3 cp s3://bucket3120/file-sync-service/greyhound_-_dog.jpeg ." the link in this command is copied file URI. "." means destionation to copy the file (current directory)
    - Correct output is "download: s3://bucket3120/file-sync-service/greyhound_-_dog.jpeg to ./greyhound_-_dog.jpeg"
to check downloaded file run the command "ls" 


TASK 3
Create an autoscaling group "SyncService-ASG" with a dynamic scaling policy to have:
min: 1 instance, desired: 1 instance, max: 4 instances
Integrate AutoScaling group with "SyncService" Load balancer.

1. Create Load Balancer (hereandafter as "LB")
    - Go to EC2, and then click on Load Balancer on the left-hand pane, click on "Create Load Balancer"
    - Choose "Application Load Balancer" type
    - Provide a name to LB
    - Choose "Internet-facing" scheme (An internet-facing load balancer routes requests from clients over the internet to targets. Requires a public subnet)
    - Ip address type leave as "IPv4"
    - Choose a required VPC from the droplist in the Network mapping section 
    - pick both AZs and both Public Subnets
    - Choose a specially Security group for Load Balancer from the droplist (you can create one in advance. In inbound rules open HTTP and HTTPS ports fot this Sec.Group)
    - In the "Listeners and Routing" section click on hypelink to create a terget group. Or you can select from the droplist that has been already created and not assign to other LB.
2. Create a target group
    - Target type "Instances"
    - Type Target group name
    - scroll down to Health checks and type "/index.html" (this step is optional)
    - Click "next"
    - DO NOT pick and include as pending any existed EC2. click on "Create target group"
1. Go back to Load Balancer creating window. 
    - Select just created Target group (refresh the droplist)
    - Scroll down and click "Create load balancer" button

3. Create an Auto Scaling group
    - Scroll down the left-hand pane and click on Auto Scaling group (as "ASG")
    - Click on "Create ASG"
    - Type the name of ASG 
    - Click on hyperlink "Create a launch template" if you do not have any templates. 
4. Create a launch Template
    - Type a name of a template
    - Scroll sown and select "Amazon Linux" AMI
    - Choose "t2.micro" instance type
    - Select a key
    - DO NOT SELECT ANY subnet
    - Create a new Security group: 
        - provide a description 
        - Add security group role: 1. Type HTTP, for sourse box select a SECURITY GROUP that has been provided to LOAD BALANCER. Add second type for HTTPS and same source. 
        - in Advanced details add bootstrap (below) for User data box. 
#!/bin/bash
# Update the system packages
yum update -y

# Install Apache HTTP server
yum install -y httpd

# Start the Apache service
systemctl start httpd

# Enable Apache to start on boot
systemctl enable httpd

# Create a basic HTML file to be served
echo "<html><head><title>  </title></head><body><h1> FILE SYNCHRONIZING SERVICE at $(hostname -f)</h1></body></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html

# Set permissions for the HTML file
chmod 644 /var/www/html/index.html
        - Create launch template
    
3. Continue creting the ASG
    - Refresh for selecting launch template, and select just created one. 
    - On the Step 2: Select a VPC and AZs and Public Subnets. Click the "Next button"
    - On the Step 3: Select "Attach to an existing load balancer". and select "Choose from your load balancer target groups"
    - Select erlier created Target group. Scroll down and click "Next"
    - On the Step 4: Indicate for Disired group size - 1, for Min - 1, for Max 4. 
    - In the Automatic scaling section choose "Target tracking scaling policy" and indicate relevant Target value and Instance warmup. Scroll down and click "Next"
    - Leave Step 5 and 6 as unchangeble. 
    - Review the ASG summary and Click "Create ASG"

To check the completness of the operation go back Load Balancer and grab the DNS name and paste to browser. 
Correct data should appear as "FILE SYNCHRONIZING SERVICE at ip-10-0-0-213.us-west-1.compute.internal"
