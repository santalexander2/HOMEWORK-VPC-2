Connect VPC to S3 bucket using VPC Gateway Endpoint

1. In the VPC dashboard click on "Endpoints" in the left-hand navigation pane
2. Click on the "Create Endpoint" button
    - Type Endpoint name
    - Select service category as "AWS services"
    - Choose "type = Gateway" as the endpoint type.
    - Select "com.amazonaws.REGION.s3" (replace REGION with the region where your S3 bucket resides) as the service name
    - Choose relevant VPC from the "VPC" dropdown list
    - Choose Route table (it could be already existed public RT)
    - Optionally, configure the endpoint policy to restrict access to specific S3 buckets by clicking "Custom" and use policy generator tool. Or leave it as "Full Access"
    - Tags are optionally. 
    - Click on the "Create endpoint" button to create the VPC endpoint.

3. Check the selected RT, it should be automatically added new route with destination as "S3 buckets" and target "ID of the Endpoints" 
4. To check connectivity between an EC2 instance in your VPC and an S3 bucket/s using a VPC endpoint, 
    - ensure that the instance has necessary IAM permissions to access S3
    - Run AWS CLI commands to access an S3 bucket. For example, to list the contents of an S3 bucket aws s3 ls s3://backet name/
                or get an object from S3 bucket by command aws s3 cp s3://path-to-bucket/ /destination/
