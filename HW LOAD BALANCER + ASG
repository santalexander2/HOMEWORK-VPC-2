1. Create 2 instances, hosting webservers, userdata is in our slack channel.

    - Navigate to EC2 service => Instances => Launch instance 
    - Change Region to us-east-1 (N. Virginia)
    - Type a name of the EC2
    - Select an AMI (Amazon Linux)
    - Instance type - t2.micro
    - Select a key (if applicable in this region)
    - Open HTTP port and you can close SHH port (Since this instances will be added to Target group you can create and apply new Security group with open 80 and 443 port but source should be indicated "Security Group that will be applied to Load Balancer". THis operation needs for double security layer. This instance will receive thaffic on port 80 and 443 only from the SG of the Load Balancer.) 
    - Add foloffing User data under the "Advanced details" section
#!/bin/bash
# Update the system packages
yum update -y

# Install Apache HTTP server
yum install -y httpd

# Start the Apache service
systemctl start httpd

# Enable Apache to start on boot
systemctl enable httpd

# Create a basic HTML file to be served
echo "<html><head><title>  </title></head><body><h1> APP NUMBER 1 ===> IP OF THIS INSTANCE IS $(hostname -f)</h1></body></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html

# Set permissions for the HTML file
chmod 644 /var/www/html/index.html

for the 2nd EC2 instance repeat the same steps and user other User data "... APP NUMBER 2....."



2. Create HW target group. Include all instances in it.  
                - Navigate to EC2 service => Target Groups => Create Target Group (TG)               
                - Choose "Instances" as a target type
                - Type a name of the TG
                - Scroll down => click "Next"
                - Pick two earlier created instances and click to "Include as pending below"
                - click "Create target group"




3. Create HW Load Balancer in us-east-1
   Create Security for Load Balancer and add two INBOUND RULES for HTTP and HTTPS ports to receive traffic from "anywhere"

    - Navigate to EC2 service => Load Balancers => Create Load Balancer (LB)
    - Choose "Application Load Balancer"
    - Select Internet-facing scheme and IPv4 as an IP address type
    - Pick at least two AZs and relevant subnets
    - Apply earlier created Security Group 
    - In the "Listeners and routing" create new Target group. 
    - Select earlier created TG
    - Click on "Create load balancer"



4. Create Autoscaling group with dynamic scaling to create instances at 80% CPU. 
    - Navigate to EC2 service => Auto Scaling Groups => Create Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
    - Type a name of the ASG
    - Click on create new Template

            Create a template
                - Type a name and description
                - Choose Amazon Linux AMI
                - Choose t2.micro as a Instance type
                - Choose a key
                - DO NOT SUBNET in launch template
                - Create a new SEcGroup (Name it and type a description, choose VPC, add 2 inbound rules for HTTP(80) and HTTPS (443) ports and as a source choose other Sec Group that was applied to Load Balancer)
                - Put an User data 
                - Click on "Create Launch Template"

Go Back to crreating ASG
    - Refresh and Select just created Launch Template => Click on "Next"
    - Choose VPC, two AZs and Subnets => Click on "Next"
    - Choose to "Attach to an existing load balancer"
    - Choose "Choose from your load balancer target groups" and Select target group that was applied to the relevant LB => Click "Next"
    - For Group Size indicate Desired-2; Min-2; Max-4;
    - Apply Automatic Scaling by chooce "Target tracking scaling policy" and change to 80% of target CPU value => Click "Next"
    - Skip Notificatios and Tags steps, review and click "Create Auto Scaling group"


5. Create A record of your domain name for your load balancer. 
- Navigate to Route53 service => Hosted Zones => Select you root domain
- Under the "Records" subsection click on "Create record"
- Leave just root domain name uand the "Record name"
- Select "A â€“ Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources"
- Switch an "Alias" button => Select "Alias to Application and Classic Load Balancer" => Choose the region "US East (N. Virginia)" => choose earlier created Load balancer. => Click "Create record"
